# Contribute here as a former New Tech!

If you are a former NT, take ownership of this repo contribute! 

Thank you for being an **awesome** NT and willing to pay it forward to upcoming NTs. 

Two options:
* Make a pull request on the README with whatever insight, correction, comment (really anything) that you want to share.
* You can DM me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamza-algamoos/) or Discord (Grimmjow#5938) and I'll gladly add whatever you want me to add.

Optional: Write up a mini-bio of yourself and I’ll put you on the list of contributors to the post. You can plug in your LinkedIn if you’d like.
