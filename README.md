* My name is Hamza[https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamza-algamoos/], and I was a New Tech during the 2021 summer. I am now an upcoming Software Engineer intern at Microsoft. First in the family to go to college. Before New Techs, I was working different crappy jobs while balancing school and struggling to break into tech.
