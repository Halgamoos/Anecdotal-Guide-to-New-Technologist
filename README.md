# Anecdotal Guide to New Techs
**Disclaimer**: This post is a completly unofficial and anecdotal guide by former NTs for upcoming NTs. The goal is to help y’all make the most out of the New Technologist program at Microsoft and Cyborg Mobile.

## Contributors
* My name is [Hamza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamza-algamoos/), and I was a New Tech during the 2021 summer. I am now an upcoming Software Engineer intern at Microsoft. First in the family to go to college. Before New Techs, I was working different crappy jobs while balancing school and struggling to break into tech. 

## About NT

### What is New Techs?

The New Techs website says, “You’ll learn all about the product lifecycle and create a prototype solution for the modern customer. What’s the product life cycle? What’s prototyping? Don’t worry…we’ll teach you! You’ll get real-world experience in web development and gain hands-on training from senior staff at Microsoft.” - https://newtechnologists.com/

I want to give you a tiny sneak peek into what you do as an NT. There are many events and meetings that are for all NTs throughout the program. These include many important meetings with the NT crew, the NT co-founders Kobie and Vanessa, guest speakers from all over Microsoft (including NT alumni!), motivational speeches that send chills down your spine, and much more. 

You will be placed into a team of 5 by the NT crew. You’ll be spending the most time with your team of 5. Together, you will choose a problem statement to solve and develop a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) using the technologies learned throughout the program (last year, it was HTML, CSS, JS, React, and Firebase). In the end, your team presents the product that you made to employees all over Microsoft. Will it be challenging? Absolutely! However, it will be a gratifying experience in the end.

Each team of 5 has two coaches, a MSFT Software Engineer and a Program Manager, aiding you along the process of developing your MVP. Each NT will also get paired with an individual mentor who is a Full-Time Employee (FTE) at MSFT. Groups of teams will be assigned to an engineering instructor, where all of you will attend hands-on lectures that teach the technologies you and your team need to implement your MVP.

### What can an NT gain through this experience?

- In the past, the “golden ticket” toward getting into tech or any field was simply having a college degree. That is no longer the case. For many, NT was the “golden ticket” opportunity that gave them the proper jumpstart they needed. This is even more true for minorities and individuals who have non-traditional backgrounds. They simply don’t have the same opportunities that most do.
- Honestly, NT is such a fun and rewarding experience. Not only do you learn a lot about the tech industry, you learn more about yourself. You get constantly pushed out of your comfort zone and end up amazed about how much you were able to accomplish so much in a short time. 
- You make so many meaningful connections and friends! You’ll meet so many bright-minded, hard-working, and enthusiastic individuals from many different backgrounds.
- Doing well in the program gets you a referral. This referral gives you an opportunity to final round interviews at Microsoft for either explore, software engineering, or program manager internships. These don’t grow on trees, ya know!
- Having Microsoft on your resume opens many doors. This means you’ll have a better chance of getting past resume screens and more opportunities to interview at other awesome companies.

## Before NT

### How to prepare?

Honestly, you’re good enough as you are right now! Don’t stress too much about being “prepared” because you were picked to be an NT for a reason. You will be taught everything you need to do well! Again, completely optional, but for those who just can’t wait to get a headstart, here are some things that might be helpful to do beforehand.

- Set up your dedicated “workspace”. If possible, since this opportunity is remote, dedicate a quiet and non-distracting space where you live **only** for working in NT. This can be as simple as a desk or table where you work on your provided work laptop. Why? Have you ever tried to focus inside a burning building? Our behavior is often influenced by the environment that we are in. For example, if you try to study in the same area you eat, Netflix and chill, and play video games, it will be too hard for you to get into deep working sessions and pay attention during your internship.

- Make a LinkedIn post about getting into NT. This is a powerful networking opportunity because other accepted NTs will connect with you and talk about how they’re looking forward to the internship. 
- Make an unofficial discord server and have enough mods to maintain the server. Add channels and bots like every other server. Mods should take responsibility for keeping the server organized and lively. I can’t imagine this past NT experience without the discord server! 

Technical Preparations:
- Install and play around with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (not “Visual Studio”!!). For example, open a file, make a new one, run your code, learn more about the terminal, find color themes you like, etc.
- Brush over basic web development in HTML, CSS, and JS. For more, challenge yourself to build a simple to-do list website. You can even follow tutorials online on youtube like the one I’ve listed below.
- Learn the basics of Git. Using Git, figure out how to contribute code to a GitHub repository. For example, find out how to create a GitHub repository, create a branch, add some random code, and commit the new code to the repository.
- Skip to the “After NT” section and get a head start for your upcoming recruiting season.
